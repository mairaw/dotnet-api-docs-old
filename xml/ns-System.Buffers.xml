## Remarks  
  
Resources of the <see cref="ArrayPool{T}"/> class are obtained by calling the <cref="Rent"/> method, and must be returned to the pool using the <see cref="Return"/> method so that they can be safely reused. By allocating shared buffer resources in this way, the <see cref="ArrayPool{T}"/> class can improve performance by relieving memory pressure on the garbage collector in situations where arrays are created and destroyed frequently.
