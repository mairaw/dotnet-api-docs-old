    <summary>Using the <see cref="N:System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader" /> namespace, you can develop applications that read and manage event logs. An event in an event log contains information, a warning, or an error that has been published by a specific application, service, or operating system component.  These events are read by applications that monitor a computer's health and applications that take action when specific events occur.  For more information, see [Technology Summary for Reading and Managing Event Logs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb671205.aspx) and [Event Log Scenarios](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb671204.aspx).</summary>
