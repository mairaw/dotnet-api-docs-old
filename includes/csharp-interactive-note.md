> [!NOTE]
> The C# examples in this article run in the [Try.NET](https://try.dot.net) inline code runner and playground. You can run an example in an interactive window by pressing the **Run** button. Once you execute the code, you can modify it and run the modified code by pressing **Run** again.  The modified code either runs in the interactive window or, if compilation fails, the interactive window displays all C# compiler error messages.
