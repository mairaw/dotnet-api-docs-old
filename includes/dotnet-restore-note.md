> [!NOTE]
> Starting with .NET Core 2.0, you don't have to run [`dotnet restore`](~/docs/core/tools/dotnet-restore.md) because it's run implicitly as part of `dotnet build` or `dotnet run`. It's still a valid command in certain scenarios where doing an explicit restore makes sense, such as [continuous integration builds in Visual Studio Team Services](/vsts/build-release/apps/aspnet/build-aspnet-core).
